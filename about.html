        <h1>About Saad Shahid</h1>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>My journey began in a small town where I was born on a sunny day, surrounded by a loving family. From a
                young age, I was fascinated by technology, often tinkering with old computers and dreaming of creating
                something impactful. My early education laid the foundation, but it was my curiosity that drove me to
                learn coding on my own during late nights.</p>
            <p>As I grew, I pursued formal education in computer science, where I discovered my passion for web
                development. I started with simple HTML pages and gradually mastered CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks
                that brought my ideas to life. Along the way, I faced challenges—tight deadlines, complex projects—but
                each hurdle taught me resilience and innovation.</p>
            <p>Beyond coding, I love exploring networking concepts, which I integrate into my work to build efficient
                systems. My hobbies include gaming, sketching futuristic designs, and mentoring young coders in my
                community. Over the years, I’ve worked on diverse projects, from e-commerce platforms to personal
                portfolios, each reflecting my growth and dedication.</p>
            <p>Today, I stand as a passionate web developer, committed to creating modern, responsive websites that
                blend aesthetics with functionality. My vision is to inspire others through my work and continue
                evolving in this ever-changing tech world. This is just the beginning of my story, and I look forward to
                what the future holds!</p>
